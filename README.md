# Fine-tuning a Pretrained Model Using LoRA

Fine-tuning a Pretrained Model Using LoRA

### Objectives:

Leverage LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation to fine-tune a pretrained language model for a programming-related Question-Answering (QA) system on the "flytech/python-codes-25k" dataset.

### Understanding LoRA

1. Review the concept, benefits, and mechanism of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for adap-
   ting pretrained models.
2. Discuss the suitability of pretrained language models for code-related QA tasks and the
   advantages of using LoRA for fine-tuning.

### Dataset Preparation

1. Provide an overview of the "flytech/python-codes-25k"dataset, focusing on its structure
   and relevance for a QA system.
2. Describe necessary preprocessing steps, including tokenization and encoding strategies for
   code snippets.

### Model Fine-Tuning with LoRA

1. Select a suitable pretrained language model and justify the choice based on its architecture
   and expected performance on code-related QA tasks.
2. Detail the integration of LoRA, specifying the adaptation process and adjustments made
   to the model for the QA task.

### Training and Evaluation

1. Outline the training process, including configurations related to LoRA, learning rate
   settings, and QA-specific adaptations.
2. Evaluate the fine-tuned model using appropriate metrics, comparing its performance with
   a baseline model.
3. Analyze the results, focusing on improvements or limitations introduced by LoRA in the
   context of programming-related QA
